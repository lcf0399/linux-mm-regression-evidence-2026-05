# MADV_PAGEOUT no-swap attribution index

This directory contains attribution material for the narrow
`MADV_PAGEOUT anon/THP no-swap reclaim-failure path`.

The kernels used here enable tracing/debugfs/function profiling. Treat these
results as mechanism evidence only, not as clean performance timing. Formal
timing remains under the workload's `formal-lab/` directory.

Current reading:

```text
The original old-faster signal is primarily tied to actual page-state
differences. v6.19.9 is actually THP-backed in the default/hugepage runs and
enters the no-swap THP split/failure path. v6.12.77 is not actually THP-backed
in the same requested mode. The nohugepage same-state control does not show a
stable old-faster signal.
```

and then `summaries/lab-multicpu-followup-20260520.zh-CN.md`.
Raw attribution run directories are excluded from the compact public bundle
unless they are needed for follow-up debugging.
