# Linux MM Regression Evidence - May 2026

This repository contains a small evidence bundle for two Linux MM performance regression reports. It is meant to make the test method, environment, raw summaries, and current attribution state auditable without putting a large attachment into the mailing-list report.

The two reports are scoped by workload:

- `madvise-pageout-thp-noswap-refault/`: `madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT)` on an anonymous THP/no-swap refault workflow.
- `mprotect-shared-dirty-toggle/`: repeated `mprotect()` toggling over a shared dirty PTE mapping.

This is not a broad benchmark suite. Each claim is limited to the workload and environment described below.

## Experiment Method

Both workloads were run through the same local experiment framework:

- Source-calibrated workloads target concrete Linux `mm/*.c` paths and export per-page timing metrics.
- Coverage and performance evidence were collected separately. Coverage runs only show direct function-entry hits; clean performance runs have coverage disabled.
- Formal performance runs use interleaved version order to reduce host-drift bias.
- The lab formal matrix uses `QEMU_SMP=1/2/4` with the same guest memory, kernel config family, and command-line policy across CPU counts.
- Release-narrowing runs compare `v6.12`, `v6.18`, and `v6.19` as a sanity check for the introduction range. They are not a replacement for the 9-repeat formal matrix.
- No commit-level bisection has been completed yet.

Primary timing metrics are lower-is-better:

- `cycle_ns_per_page`
- `advise_ns_per_page` for the `MADV_PAGEOUT` syscall/reclaim-side segment

The exact per-run metadata is preserved in `pipeline_run_env.json`, `execution_order.json`, `*.summary.csv/json`, and `*.raw.csv/json`.

## Environment Summary

The formal evidence uses the lab server as the primary timing environment:

- Host label in metadata: `lcf`
- Host kernel: `Linux 6.14.0-37-generic x86_64`
- Host CPU count: 128
- Container/cgroup CPU set: `0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14`
- Container/cgroup memory limit: `16106127360` bytes
- QEMU: `qemu-system-x86_64 8.2.2`
- Guest memory: `QEMU_MEM_MB=14336`
- Guest CPUs: `QEMU_SMP=1/2/4`
- Timing order: interleaved version order
- Formal repetitions: 9
- Performance timing: coverage disabled

The release-narrowing sanity checks include both lab and local runs:

- Local host label in metadata: `kernel-vm`
- Local host kernel: `Linux 6.8.0-110-generic x86_64`
- Local host CPU count: 8
- Local QEMU: `qemu-system-x86_64 8.2.2`
- Local guest memory: `QEMU_MEM_MB=4096`
- Release-narrowing versions: `v6.12`, `v6.18`, and `v6.19`
- Release-narrowing repetitions: 1, used only as a sanity check for the introduction range

The exact per-run environment remains in `pipeline_run_env.json`; this section is only a human-readable summary.

## Current Attribution

The attribution notes below are mechanism interpretation. The formal performance claims still rely on the clean timing runs with coverage/probe instrumentation disabled.

### MADV_PAGEOUT / THP / No-swap Refault

The current interpretation is not a generic `madvise()` slowdown and not a generic `MADV_PAGEOUT` slowdown.

The regression is scoped to this workflow:

1. map 16 MiB anonymous memory
2. let the mapping use the default THP path
3. run `madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT)` in a guest with no configured swap
4. refault/write-touch the mapping

The timing split points to the `MADV_PAGEOUT` / reclaim part, not the refault touch part. Coverage and follow-up path validation point to the same reclaim/swap-failure chain:

```text
madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT)
  -> reclaim_pages()
  -> shrink_folio_list()
  -> folio_alloc_swap()
  -> swap allocation failure path
```

The important boundary is the no-swap THP path. In this environment, pageout of a THP-backed anonymous mapping can hit a worst case where swap allocation fails, THP handling/splitting is involved, and the reclaim path retries at page granularity. That is why this should be reported as a THP + `MADV_PAGEOUT` + no-swap refault workflow regression, not as a claim about all swap-backed or all `MADV_PAGEOUT` workloads.

Release narrowing shows `v6.18.19` already in the slow range, but the exact culprit commit is not bisected.

### mprotect Shared-dirty Toggle

The current mechanism hypothesis is more localized here.

The workload repeatedly toggles protection over a shared dirty 64 MiB mapping. The strongest attribution points to the v6.19 `change_pte_range()` batching rewrite:

```text
change_pte_range()
  -> mprotect_folio_pte_batch()
  -> modify_prot_start_ptes()
  -> set_write_prot_commit_flush_ptes()
  -> prot_commit_flush_ptes()
```

For this shared-dirty workload, the measured path does not form an effective large PTE batch. Batch-probe attribution showed `nr_ptes=1` for the shared-dirty path. That means the extra folio lookup, batch-size query, helper dispatch, and batch commit machinery are paid per 4 KiB PTE, but there is no batch-size amortization.

This also explains why the result should not be generalized to all `mprotect()` users. Anonymous THP-oriented `mprotect()` paths can go through huge-PMD/THP handling and do not show the same behavior in the same test suite. The regression claim is therefore scoped to the shared dirty PTE toggle path.

Release narrowing shows `v6.18.19` already in the slow range, but the exact culprit commit is not bisected.

## Data Selection Policy

This repository only includes the latest citable evidence bundle for the two reports:

- latest lab formal refresh results for the main performance claims
- latest local/lab release-narrowing results for introduction-range sanity checks
- separate coverage evidence where useful, kept distinct from clean performance timing

Older screenings, invalid runs, failed runs, instrumentation-contaminated runs, and exploratory intermediate outputs are intentionally not uploaded here. They are kept out of the upstream evidence bundle so the reports stay focused on the latest citable data.

## Main Caveats

The reports are not claiming generic `madvise()` or generic `mprotect()` regressions.

The `MADV_PAGEOUT` claim is scoped to the anonymous THP/no-swap refault/write-touch workflow.

The `mprotect()` claim is scoped to the shared dirty full-range protection-toggle workload; the cleanest current formal result is the 1CPU lab run, while 2CPU and 4CPU are same-direction supporting evidence with reliability caveats.

No culprit commit has been bisected yet. The release narrowing currently points to `v6.12..v6.18`.
