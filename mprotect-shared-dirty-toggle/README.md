# mprotect Shared-dirty Toggle Evidence

This directory supports the report:

```text
[REGRESSION] mm/mprotect: shared dirty PTE toggle path is ~40% slower on v6.19 than v6.12
```

## Claim scope

This is a userspace-visible `mprotect()` workload:

- shared dirty 64 MiB mapping
- repeated full-range protection toggle
- focus on the shared-dirty PTE path

It does not claim a generic `mprotect()` regression, and does not claim `anon_full_toggle` or THP mprotect regression.

## Key result

Formal lab timing shows `v6.19.9` slower than `v6.12.77`.

`cycle_ns_per_page`:

| CPU | v6.12.77 | v6.19.9 | delta | reliability |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 346.8 | 578.1 | -40.0% | clean reliable |
| 2 | 394.7 | 641.7 | -38.5% | robust-only |
| 4 | 381.1 | 624.8 | -39.0% | partial same direction |

Separate release-level sanity checks showed `v6.18.19` already in the slow range, but those raw runs are kept out of this compact public evidence bundle.

## Follow-up Results

David Hildenbrand pointed to Pedro Falcato's recent small-folio mprotect
optimization. A lab sanity matrix against `akpm/mm mm-unstable
444fc9435e57` shows partial mitigation in this workload, but not a return
to `v6.12.77` timing:

| CPU | v6.12.77 | v6.19.9 | mm-unstable | mm-unstable vs v6.19 | gap closed |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 336.1 | 532.0 | 497.0 | 6.6% faster | 17.9% |
| 2 | 369.2 | 581.9 | 503.3 | 13.5% faster | 36.9% |
| 4 | 355.7 | 587.2 | 524.2 | 10.7% faster | 27.2% |
| 8 | 369.7 | 583.6 | 534.2 | 8.5% faster | 23.1% |
| 16 | 374.8 | 607.1 | 547.8 | 9.8% faster | 25.5% |

The 16 CPU row has one `v6.12.77` QEMU failure in that sanity matrix, so it
is supporting trend evidence only.

A separate state-shape audit checked whether this mprotect comparison has a
`MADV_PAGEOUT`-style caveat where kernels operate on materially different
page/VMA state. The state audit found the successful `v6.12.77`, `v6.19.9`,
and `mm-unstable` runs all using the same 4 KiB shared-dirty PTE mapping
shape: 16384 present pages before/after, no THP backing, one final VMA, and
no semantic mismatches. That supports treating the remaining timing gap as a
same-state implementation-path cost rather than a mismatched workload-state
comparison.
