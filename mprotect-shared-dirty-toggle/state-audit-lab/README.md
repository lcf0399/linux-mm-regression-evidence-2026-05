# mprotect Shared-dirty State Audit - Lab

This run is a state-shape audit for the `shared_dirty_full_toggle_64m`
workload. It is meant to rule out a `madvise`-style caveat where different
kernel versions operate on materially different mapping state.

This is not a performance claim and should not be used as old-faster evidence.
It checks:

- semantic success: `expected_match_ratio`, `unexpected_results`
- VMA shape: `split_vmas_avg`, `final_vmas_avg`
- smaps: AnonHugePages, KernelPageSize, MMUPageSize, THPeligible
- pagemap: present pages, soft-dirty pages

Planned matrix:

```text
1 CPU / 14336 MiB
2 CPU / 14336 MiB
4 CPU / 14336 MiB
8 CPU / 16384 MiB
16 CPU / 32768 MiB
```

Kernel versions:

```text
v6.12.77
v6.19.9
akpm/mm mm-unstable 444fc9435e57
```

## Result Summary

```

Short version: successful runs across `v6.12.77`, `v6.19.9`, and
`mm-unstable` all reported `expected_match_ratio=100`,
`unexpected_results=0`, one final VMA, 16384 present pages before and after
the protection cycle, `AnonHugePages=0`, 4 KiB kernel/MMU page size, and
`THPeligible=0`.

This supports treating the mprotect comparison as a same-state shared-dirty
4 KiB PTE workload comparison. Raw runner directories and launch logs are
excluded from the compact public evidence bundle by `.gitignore`; they can be
provided separately if they are needed for follow-up debugging.
